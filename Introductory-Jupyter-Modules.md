A place to put some introductory resources on various sampling/analysis techniques. 

These were originally developed for Advanced Special Topics in Chemical Theory, taught by Prof. Aaron Dinner in the Spring of 2019. The Ising Model/Umbrella Sampling module was adapted from an example generously provided by [Prof. Glen Hocky at NYU](https://hockygroup.hosting.nyu.edu/), a former postdoc in the group.
