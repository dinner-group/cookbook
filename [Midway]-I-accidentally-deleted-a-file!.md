# [Midway]-I-accidentally-deleted-a-file!.md
Problem
-------

An errant rm -rf annihilated your entire project a week before an important presentation.

Solution
--------

If your files were in _/home_ or _/project2_, there may be backups located in _/snapshots/home_ or _/snapshots/project2_, respectively.Â _/cds_ should also have backups...somewhere.

If your files were on _/scratch_, they are gone forever.
