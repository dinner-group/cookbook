Welcome to the Dinner Cookbook, the wiki for Dinner Group at UChicago. This is supposed to be a place to document all of our institutional memory, providing tips, guides, and walkthroughs for problems that are frequently encountered for various subsets of the group. Overall, we don't want to reinvent the wheel if we don' have to. You should look through these pages (including the troubleshooting and how-tos) by using the Page Tree in the sidebar to see if a problem or specific error you are running into has been documented before!

On the flip side, any time you solve a problem, institutional knowledge is created. If you think that your solution/observation has even a small chance of being useful to someone else in the group at some point down the line, please add a page documenting it! You can do this using the Create tab on the top bar. You can then place it effectively in the page tree by either dragging and dropping on the side bar, or going to Space Tools â†’ Reorder pages. This will work the best if we are all actively maintaining it, and is much more permanent and searchable than posting something on Slack. Happy wiki-ing!
