# AFINES
AFINES is our in-house simulation package for cytoskeletal networks, developed mostly by Simon Freedman. It is written in C++11 and depends on Boost.

The main branch of the code can be found at [https://github.com/Simfreed/AFINES](https://github.com/Simfreed/AFINES).

Chatipat and Steven have their own branch of the code, which can be found at [https://github.com/Chatipat-and-Steven-friendship-forever/AFINES](https://github.com/Chatipat-and-Steven-friendship-forever/AFINES).

AFINES is currently not parallelized and only runs on a single CPU, so please don't use an entire node for a single simulation.
